# Pure Data files

My personal pd files. Contains patches for sound, sending/receiving osc, generative music and more. Playground and resource for improving my sound design techniques and DSP knowledge, creating live performances or control external Synthesizers.

## Todos
* general naming scheme
* organise patches to abstractions
* organise lira-8 delay, reverbs

## Externals used

I do use some externals and sometimes patches found in the internet.

e.g.:
* cyclone
* cexy
* iemlib
* [Tom Erbe reverbs](http://tre.ucsd.edu/wordpress/?p=625)
* ggee
* [LIRA-8](https://github.com/MikeMorenoDSP/LIRA-8)

## Main Dome
```maindome.pd``` is for playing and controlling sounds on a multi-channel speaker setup in conjunction with a light installation in the spirit of blinkenlights.

## Sequencers
A variety of sequencers for e.g. generating simple chord progressions my Waldorf Blofeld, a work in progress patch for using the Arturia Beatstep as a euclidean step sequencer.

## 808 Sounds
I tried to work on some 808 sounds based on papers. So far a work in progress but with capable results.

## Tom Erbe reverbs
I can not recommend these reverbs enough. They are essential for my sound designs.

## LIRA-8
I isolated the amazing delay made by Mike Moreno.
